# Cube Sniper

Cube Sniper is a program that I use to find World Cube Association competitions within a reasonable driving distance of our home.
The WCA website itself allows searching by coarse regions but not by radius. Thus Cube Sniper.

## Getting Started

Build the project with:
```
cargo build
```

Or just run it with:
```
cargo run -- USA 38.9779,-77.0075
```
